## Things under consideration
#
# Which term to be used for :moreSpecifically?
# Cf. sdo:workExample | skos:narrower | ^(sdo:model|rdfa:copy) ...
#
# We consider levels of specificity to be more useful than separating out
# sdo:Offer entities from a compound sdo:SomeProducts entity. This is more in
# line with BibFrame, although we're not sure if bf:hasComponent properly
# conveys the notion of "more specific entity". (Also, BF1 had distinct levels
# for "some" and "one" in bf1:HeldMaterial and bf1:HeldItem respectively,
# whereas BF2 "only" has bf2:Item.)
#
# Note that putting the "access and custodian" properties on the bf1:Item is
# more conflating than describing this using some qualified relation entity
# (which e.g. Offer does, perhaps even bf1:Annotation do). It isn't necessarily
# illogical though (the item is at shelf X, is owned by Y and can be lent under
# condition Z). The utility of a qualified entity combining these facts should
# be considered though to make an informed decision about it.
